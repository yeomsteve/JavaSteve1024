		iPhone, series of smartphones produced by Apple Inc., combining mobile telephone, digital camera, music player, and personal computing technologies. After more than two years of development, the device was first released in the United States in 2007. The iPhone was subsequently released in Europe in 2007 and Asia in 2008.

		Apple designed its first mobile smartphone to run the Mac OS X operating system, made popular on the company’s personal computers. The device’s most revolutionary element was its touch-sensitive multisensor interface. The touchscreen allowed users to manipulate all programs and telephone functions with their fingertips rather than a stylus or physical keys. This interface—perfected, if not invented, by Apple—recreated a tactile physical experience; for example, the user could shrink photos with a pinching motion or flip through music albums using a flicking motion. The iPhone also featured Internet browsing, music and video playback, a digital camera, visual voicemail, and a tabbed contact list.
